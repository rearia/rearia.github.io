This device works as intermediary between hearing aid and the audio source, such as TV or phone, transmitting the audio from source to the hearing aid.</p>\n      <p>However, the reason we wanted to re-invent the streamer is that they are not universal, they only work for specific hearing conditions. There are some different models, but their sound quality is inferior. Most streamers don't work in combination with normal earphones, and so listening music with single hearing aid and normal earphones is impossible.</p>\n      <p>Another aspect is that these good quality ones are mostly made by medical device companies, and it can be seen in they style and design.</p>\n      <p>We wanted to create a modular streamer that would allow people to wear the style they want and provide excellent sound quality in a completely modular product. We also wanted to free it from the medical image, and make it like any other audio device that the user can customize and express their style.</p>\n      <p>Now we have been working on this project for 3 years and have come a long way. Finally our product is ready, and we call it Hai.
